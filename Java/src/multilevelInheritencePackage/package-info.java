/*In this example we have three classes –  Car, Maruti and Maruti800. 
 * We have done a setup – class Maruti extends Car and class Maurit800 extends Maurti. 
 * With the help of this Multilevel hierarchy setup our Maurti800 class is able to use 
 * the methods of both the classes (Car and Maruti).*
