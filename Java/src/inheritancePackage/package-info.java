/*Inheritance is one of the feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs). 
 *Inheritance allows a class to use the properties and methods of another class. 
 *In other words, the derived class inherits the states and behaviors from the base class. 
 *The derived class is also called subclass and the base class is also known as super-class. 
 *The derived class can add its own additional variables and methods. 
 *These additional variable and methods differentiates the derived class from the base class.

Inheritance is a compile-time mechanism. 
A super-class can have any number of subclasses. 
But a subclass can have only one superclass. 
This is because Java does not support multiple inheritance.

The superclass and subclass have “is-a” relationship between them.*
